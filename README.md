## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

  ```bash
  $ sudo apt install nodejs
  $ sudo apt install npm
  ```

- #### Other Operating Systems

  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

```bash
$ node --version
v13.7.0

$ npm --version
6.13.6
```

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

```
$ npm install npm -g
```

### Yarn installation

  After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.

```
  $ npm install -g yarn
```

------
